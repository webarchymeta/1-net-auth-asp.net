## 1-NET

It is a system consisting of services and clients for users to connect their computers, smart devices of increasing varieties in anywhere and at anytime. It tries to be device and network agnostic so that devices can be cross connected on the internet over any IP based networks, like ethernet, wifi or 3G/4G/5G mobile ones. It is simple to use, plugin and setup free. Major features of 1-NET can be reashed in one to two clicks of buttons.

It can be used to exchange data, streaming realtime video/audio between devices and/or other users, text/audio/video chat, manage and control devices locally or remotely, etc.

There are a mixture of ways that a user can use to connect their devices together. One can use a browser or an app on devices where the app is available.

## 1-NET authentication service

1-NET provides both user and endpoint (application) identification and authentication means for itself and third parties. The later use it as an OAuth 2.0 service. 

The endpoint authentication is performed in background so that the users of the third parties can enjoy the benefit of both simplified usage experience and (automated) multi-factor authentication. The unified endpoint identification and authentication means makes it possible of third parties to enforce stronger, more accurate and yet none interruptive access control.

## This package

The present package is a prototipical Asp.Net website and library that uses 1-NET authentication service that can be customized to provide fine grained role and endpoint based access control using white and/or black list.
